ToDo:
Two main things left to do in the main game: checking if a full colour set is owned, keep track of the game statistics.
Other than that, UI needs to be made for the main game

Game things:
- Add check for full colour set owned when buying houses
- Add double rent cost when a full colour set is owned
- Implement selling houses and properties when a player can't afford something

- Check if player can gain rent in jail when paying to somebody else.
- Add fast bankruptcies

UI Things:
- hide dice after rolling for a double in jail
- Make mortgaging and houses work
- Play tokens moving around the game board
- when landing on properties, the buttons are not hidden after rolling a double.
