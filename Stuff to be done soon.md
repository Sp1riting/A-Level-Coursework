ToDo:
Two main things left to do in the main game: checking if a full colour set is owned, keep track of the game statistics.
Other than that, UI needs to be made for the main game

Game things:
- Add check for full colour set owned when buying houses
- Add double rent cost when a full colour set is owned


UI Things:
- Make mortgaging and houses work
- wait a second after chance card is landed on
- the buttons are not hidden after rolling a double after landing on properties, or when using the houses or mortgage buttons.


- Clean up mortgage, houses and trade indicators by putting them into the gameValues class
- Eventually remove the chance symbol from the background image, move title up and chance text down.
