ToDo:
Once main thing left to do in the main game: checking if a full colour set is owned
Other than that, UI and database need to be started


- Add check for full colour set owned when buying houses
- Add double rent cost when a full colour set is owned
- Implement selling houses and properties when a player can't afford something

- Check if player can gain rent in jail when paying to somebody else.
- Add fast bankruptcies
